# Because geocoder2 1.4.0 depends on http ^0.13.4 and no versions of geocoder2 match >1.4.0 <2.0.0, geocoder2 ^1.4.0 requires http ^0.13.4.
#So, because cabdriver depends on both geocoder2 ^1.4.0 and http ^1.2.1, version solving failed.

# Because geoflutterfire2 >=2.3.14 depends on rxdart ^0.27.7 and flutter_google_places 0.3.0 depends on rxdart ^0.26.0, geoflutterfire2 >=2.3.14 is incompatible with flutter_google_places 0.3.0.
#And because no versions of flutter_google_places match >0.3.0 <0.4.0, geoflutterfire2 >=2.3.14 is incompatible with flutter_google_places ^0.3.0.
#So, because cabdriver depends on both flutter_google_places ^0.3.0 and geoflutterfire2 ^2.3.15, version solving failed.
